categories: Activity Shortest Path Dijkstra
---

## Learning Goals

You will work towards being able to...

1. Recall the core principles behind canonical algorithms (Prim's, Kruskal's, Dijkstra's) 

2. Prove the (in)correctness of algorithmic techniques.

## Activity

1. Prove that Dijkstra's algorithm is *not* correct for all graphs with negative weights. Do this by constructing a counterexample: Draw me a graph with negative edge weights and show that Dijkstra's algorithm returns the incorrect shortest path. 

2. Step through the pseudocode for Dijkstra's on the following Graph, representing Dutch cities and the rough travel time between them in minutes. Start by computing a shortest path tree rooted at Amsterdam (Run Dijkstra's without a target node, running it until you run out of paths to consider in the PQueue). Then try running Kruskal's and Prim's to get a MST.
