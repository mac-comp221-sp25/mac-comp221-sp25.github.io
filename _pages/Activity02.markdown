## Learning Goals

You will work towards being able to...

1. Formalize algorithmic ideas into pseudocode
2. Compute growth functions from time & space complexities under the RAM model 
2. Determine the Big-O, big-$\Omega$, and big-$\Theta$ time complexities of algorithms
3. Know common algorithms to solve cannonical problems (sorting)

## Instructions

1. Look back at the pseudocode you've written for Activity 1 (check your Moodle submission)

2. Determine an explicit growth function for your pseudocode's worst-case time complexity. **If the sort algorithm you found is suspiciously similar to insertion sort, take a moment to chat with an adjacent group and acquire a copy of their pseudocode**

3. Use your prior background from COMP128 to speculate about the big-Oh time complexity of your algorithm. Do people at the table agree? 

4. Formally demonstrate how your growth function fits that time-complexity. Consider both big-O and big-$\Omega$ (and, thus, big-$\Theta$). 

5. If you have extra time, consider the best-case time complexity! When does that occur? 

6. **For credit**: Submit some artifact of your work to Moodle, including, at least, the growth function and the time complexity (in Big-Oh) that you found.
